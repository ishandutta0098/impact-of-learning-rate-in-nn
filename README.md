# Impact of Learning Rate in a Neural Network
In this project we will understand how varying the learning can impact the parameters i.e., the weights and biases of a neural network. 

We use the FashionMNIST dataset and implement a simple neural network with 3 experiments-
1. High Learning Rate: 1e-1
2. Medium Learning Rate: 1e-3
3. Low Learning Rate: 1e-5

For all these experiments, we demonstrate the following metrics:
1. Training and Validation Losses
2. Training and Validation Accuracies
3. Parameter DIstributions
